I am a linguist interested in how articulation relates to acoustics, phonological inventories, language variation and change, language acquisition, and anatomy. I have been working in the Jacox Lab in the Adams School of Dentistry at UNC since May of 2024. I completed my Master's in Sociolinguistics at NC State (Go Pack!) in 2024 and my Bachelor's in Linguistics and French at the University of Kansas (Rock Chalk!!) in 2021.

More to be added soon...
