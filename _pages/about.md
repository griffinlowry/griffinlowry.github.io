I am a first year PhD student at Indiana University (Go Hoosiers! ❤️🤍) studying linguistics and minoring in speech and hearing sciences. I am interested in how articulation relates to acoustics, phonological inventories, language variation and change, language acquisition, and anatomy. Most of my research thus far has focused on dialects of North American English, but I am also interested in doing cross-linguistic research that aims to further understand the mechanisms of language change.

Before coming to Indiana, I was a research coordinator at the
<a href="https://www.jacoxlab.com" title="Jacox Lab | UNC Dental Research"> Jacox Lab </a> in the Adams School of Dentistry at UNC since May of 2024. I completed my Master's in Sociolinguistics at NC State (Go Pack! ❤️🐺) in 2024 and my Bachelor's in Linguistics and French at the University of Kansas (Rock Chalk!! ❤️💙) in 2021.
